# Graph Algorithms Repository

This repository provides an implementation of a graph data structure, `graph_t`, and various algorithms related to graph theory in the C programming language.

The knowledge and code in this repository are based on the concepts covered in the course SCC0216 - Computational Modeling with Graphs - ICMC/USP, taught by Professor Maria Cristina Ferreira de Oliveira.

## Covered Topics

The repository covers the following topics:

1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Directed Graphs
3. Non-Directed Graphs
4. Weighted Graphs
5. Breadth First Search (BFS)
6. Depth First Search (DFS)
7. Topological Sorting
8. Fleury Algorithm (Eulerian Cycles)
9. Welsh Powell Algorithm (Graph Coloring)
10. Prim's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Trees)
11. Tarjan Algorithm (Connected/Strongly Connected Components in Non-Directed/Directed Graphs)
12. Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford Algorithms (Single Source Shortest Paths)
13. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (All Pairs Shortest Paths)

These topics serve as a foundation for understanding and working with graph structures and algorithms.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference or starting point for your own projects involving graphs and related computations.
